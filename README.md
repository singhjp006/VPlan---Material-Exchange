A Website that focusses upon Zero Waste Technology such that discarded materials of one industry become resources for the other. I aspire to provide a link between different industries so as to ensure minimization as well as optimum utilization of waste.

The website will provide an interactive interface to help people from different industries to know about techniques for minimizing waste generation and improving productivity.
Also it will provide a medium by which they can sell their waste to other industries for whom it might be a good resource.

A zero waste based strategy would support all three of the generally accepted goals of sustainability- economic well-being, environmental protection and social well-being.
Implementing Zero Waste will eliminate all discharges to land, water or air that are a threat to planetary, human, animal or plant health.

The best thing about the theme is that it would not only provide ways for waste
minimization but would also ensure its optimum utilisation by means of TRADE.
Trading between different industries to ensure zero waste technology would help improve economy of the country and bring about a new revolution in the history of waste management.
